## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Live price configuration

- Set `FX_API_URL` and `FX_API_KEY` to a real market data provider to enable nearest-zone proximity against current quotes.
- If those variables are missing, the scanner now falls back to the most recent daily close so the UI still shows proximity and trade candidates. The response carries `livePrice.source: "fallback"` and an `ENV_MISSING` error to make the data provenance clear.
- GPT models are not suitable price feeds; use a financial market API (e.g., your broker or a quotes vendor) for production data.

## Trading scanner flow

Each scan starts in `src/lib/trading/engine.ts`, which pulls daily OHLC data and classifies macro trend, trend day, and premium/discount location via `trend-analysis.ts`. It clusters recent opens/closes into structural zones with `zones.ts`, measures how far price sits from the nearest zone (ATR-aware) in `nearest-zone.ts`, and tracks live pullback depth plus historical sweet-spot alignment from `pullback-analysis.ts`/`sweet-spot.ts`. The resulting snapshot feeds `SymbolCard` in `src/components/trading/symbol-card.tsx`, where badges and blocks mirror those fields (macro trend badge, ATR(20), nearest-zone distance, pullback bucket, sweet-spot state, and candidate status). Reuse the shared helpers in `src/hooks` and `src/lib/utils.ts`, and follow the spacing/typography tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/components/ui` when extending the UI.

## Trend continuation playbook

Use this quick-reference checklist to execute a trend continuation strategy the day after a confirmed trend day:

1. **Expect a controlled pullback** – After a strong move (e.g., a bull trend day), anticipate a correction or retest lower to set up the next leg of the trend rather than chasing price higher.
2. **Frame the opportunity** – The pullback creates the "buy low" entry (for bullish continuations), either by shaking out late buyers or letting larger players scale in at better prices.
3. **Anchor to objective levels** – Focus entries around predefined areas that often act as support/resistance:
   - **Historical price markers**: prior day high/low/close, prior support/resistance (especially resistance turned support), and notable swing highs/lows.
   - **Dynamic trend guides**: pullbacks into moving averages that match trend strength—20-period for very strong trends, 50-period for healthy trends (common swing entry), and 200-period when the trend is weak.
   - **Geometric retracements**: Fibonacci zones at 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and deeper 71–78.6% levels to bracket expected retrace depth.
4. **Favor confluence** – When multiple signals (e.g., a Fibonacci level overlapping a moving average and a prior swing high) align, treat it as a higher-probability continuation zone.
